Hi, I’m Johannes.<br>
はじめまして、ヨハネスと言います。

I am a designer and artist based in Leipzig, Germany.<br>
My work focuses on designing for the visual, auditory, and haptic senses and I strive<br>
to create both meaningful and delightful experiences for people.

I make apps for [Kadomaru Shōkai](https://kadomaru.app) and I’m part of the design team at [ottonova](https://ottonova.de/en).<br>
I have also been a lecturer at [Dessau Department of Design](https://hs-anhalt.de/hochschule-anhalt/design/uebersicht.html).

In 2024, I graduated from _Dessau Department of Design_ with<br>
a master’s degree in Intermedia Design.

From October 2019 to February 2020, I studied Graphic Design<br>
at [Arts University Plymouth](https://aup.ac.uk).

Some things that interest me are 🌍 web development, 📱 interface design,<br>
🪄 3D graphics & animation, 🙌 community-driven projects,<br>
🌱 sustainability, and ✨ other awesome stuff.

日本語を勉強している。
