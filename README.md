Hi, I’m Johannes.

I am a designer and artist based in the Bauhaus city of Dessau in Germany.<br>
My work focuses on designing for the visual, auditory, and haptic senses and I strive<br>
to create both meaningful and delightful experiences for people.

I’m part of the design team at [ottonova](https://ottonova.de/en).

In 2022, I graduated from [Dessau Department of Design](https://hs-anhalt.de/hochschule-anhalt/design/uebersicht.html) with<br>
a bachelor’s degree in Integrated Design.

From October 2019 to February 2020, I studied Graphic Design<br>
at [Arts University Plymouth](https://aup.ac.uk).

Some things that interest me are 🌍 web development, 📱 interface design,<br>
🪄 3D graphics & animation, 🙌 community-driven projects,<br>
🌱 sustainability, and ✨ other awesome stuff.
